# Code of Conduct

The Qur'an CLI community is dedicated to providing a welcoming, respectful, safe, and inclusive environment for all contributors, including users and maintainers. Therefore, we require all participants to adhere to the following Code of Conduct.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and being willing to take corrective action, including warning or bans, in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, available at <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html>.

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct, and to politely and respectfully follow any instructions given by project maintainers in response to any behavior that violates this code. We expect all community participants to help enforce this code by reporting unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.
